# Home-automation-google-assistant
 The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using Node MCU board with Internet being remotely controlled by Google Assistant. As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches. Presently, conventional wall switches located in different parts of the house makes it difficult for the user to go near them to operate. Even more it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. Remote controlled home automation system provides a most modern solution with smart phones. People come home exhausted after a long working day so any small device that would help them switch their lights and fans would make their home more comfortable. Moreover, it would be better if everything such as bath water, adjusting room temperature were done before they Rach their home just by giving a voice command. Remote control home automation system provides a most modern solution.
